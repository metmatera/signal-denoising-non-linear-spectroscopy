# Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks based approach for signal denoising in non-linear spectroscopy applications

A project in collaboration with INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare). It is based on the development of neural network based algorithms and signal denoising for Raman spectroscopy and related applications. This project involves the development of artificial intelligence algorithms and neural networks that can isolate the Raman signal from spurious non-linear contributions.
